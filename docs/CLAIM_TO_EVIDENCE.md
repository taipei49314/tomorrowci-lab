# Claim-to-evidence matrix

Statuses: **PASS** / **FAIL** / **BLOCKED** / **NOT_RUN** only.

Version `0.2.0-alpha.1` is distributed as an immutable, project-operated
external-testing prerelease. It does not supersede the bounded alpha.2
observations, and its frozen candidate manifest is not a formal release or
independent external-qualification PASS. Run-bound current truth is maintained
in the [qualification status record](qualification/STATUS.md).

| Tag | Disposition |
|-----|-------------|
| `v0.1.0` | REJECTED product candidate |
| `v0.1.0-grok-session` | REJECTED historical parallel candidate; annotated tag object `39011d3b`, peeled commit `7a08c488` |
| `v0.1.1-alpha.1` | REJECTED acceptance candidate / live-path demonstration |
| `v0.1.1-alpha.2` | Published measured lab prerelease — see bounded gates below |
| `v0.2.0-alpha.1` | Project-operated external-testing prerelease; exact public bytes passed anonymous read-back, formal promotion remains BLOCKED |

These values identify different layers and are not interchangeable. See the
full [qualification baseline](qualification/BASELINE.md) for the tag ledger
and release read-back.

## Historical alpha.2 bounded gates

This table preserves the alpha.2 observation. Its `NOT_RUN` rows describe that
historical release and are not rewritten by later M2 source qualification.

## M2 exact-master bounded gates

The current M2 PASS is limited to Linux Docker and the checked-in dependency
fixtures. Node/Rust M3 runtime qualification, Podman, the platform matrix, and
external adoption remain separate gates.

## M4 bounded engineering slices

The first three PASS rows establish implementation and CI behavior. The live
row is a separate run-bound project-owned observation; none establishes broad
platform support or independent qualification.
